## Introduction 💁🏽‍♂️


Welcome a simple Instagram clone. i'm so excited to share this fullStack application with you. Everyone know Instagram. I tried to make a clone of the original platform by using Node.JS, MongoDB, ReactJS and React-Native. This application is a simple project but  I’ve learned a ton of stuff from it. I hope all of you will enjoy exploring it and if you have any feedback, you can create an issue and I will be happy to read them all and fix it if it's a bug.
